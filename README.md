My motivation behind this project was to create something that would allow users to generate a site page that tracks the manager, engineers, and interns working on a project. This project is looking to make creating such a site, easy, clean, and fast. I learned a lot about inquirer, and utilizing data to inject into html in this project and I'm very pleased with the result.
